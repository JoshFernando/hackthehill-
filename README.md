Inspiration
Hackathons are full of creative ideas and competition, but predicting which projects will shine is a challenge. I wanted to create a fun, interactive way to engage with hackathons beyond coding.

What It Does
HackBet allows users to bet on projects they think will be finalists in a hackathon. A slot machine feature displays random projects to explore, making betting both entertaining and impactful.

How We Built It
The frontend was developed in React, and the backend leverages MongoDB for data handling. Smart contracts were created using Solidity and deployed with Foundry. HackBet is live on Linea, Flow, and Morph with Dynamic wallet integration.

Challenges We Ran Into
Creating a seamless slot machine experience, ensuring secure and fair betting, and integrating multiple blockchains were significant challenges. Balancing functionality with user experience was a learning curve.

Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Successfully building the project solo within a weekend and integrating multiple blockchain networks. Also, the charitable aspect adds a meaningful impact beyond just the game.

What We Learned
Gained a deeper understanding of building decentralized apps from scratch, creating intuitive betting mechanics, and handling cross-chain deployments effectively.

What's Next for HackBet
The next steps include improving the UI for a smoother experience, adding more betting options, expanding to additional blockchains, and enhancing the platform's community aspect through social features.
